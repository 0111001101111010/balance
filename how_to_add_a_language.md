One of the cool things about Balance is that we can support lots of languages, including niche populations that aren't normally included on the State EBT hotlines. Here's how you can help us add a new language:

1. **Open this Google Doc**: https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheets/d/1LohFjcmTvC2-NwMBsKePPwJ3uOtm_rNtDStWUFtq9Xg/edit#gid=0
2. **Text translations**: Find your language and translate each row. Note that text messages can't be more than 160 characters, so please be brief and keep the character count nice and green! When you get to the last row, go to step #3.
3. **Your voice**: When somebody accidentally calls Balance (instead of texting), we want them to hear a friendly human voice telling them what to do next. That's where you come in:
    1. First, translate this: `Hi! We can help you check your balance. Please reply to the text message we just sent you with your EBT card number. OR, press 1 to be connected to the state phone system.`
    2. Then call this number: (415) 969-3923
    3. Wait for the beep
    4. Now read your translation into the voicemail machine. Feel free to try it a few times and we will edit out the best take.
4. **Show yourself!** Email jacob@codeforamerica.org so we can finish the job on our end.
